# Results Folder

This folder stores **outputs generated from experiments** in the MSc dissertation project.  

##  Contents
- **Metrics reports** (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, silhouette values).  
- **Plots and visualisations** (e.g., confusion matrices, drift monitoring charts, segmentation clusters).  
- **Intermediate artefacts** (if small, such as trained lightweight models).  

##  Usage
All results here are **generated automatically** from the notebooks in `/notebooks/`.  
They provide evidence for evaluation and reproducibility in the dissertation.  

⚠️ **Note**: Large binary files (e.g., full model checkpoints) are not uploaded to GitHub due to storage limits.
